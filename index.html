         <p>Last year we decided to take a big trip after our son Nicholas graduated from Kirkwoood High School. </p>
         <div>
            <img src="Images\kgDk3kU-.jpg" style=max-width:100%; alt="Lake Erie" />
         </div>
         <h1>First Stop: Lake Erie</h1>
         <p>We rented a small Airbnb on Lake Erie.  It was so beautiful, but the weather didn't cooperate! It rained the whole time we were there!</p>>
         <div>
            <img src="Images\longLiveRock.jpg" max-width:100%; />

         <h1>Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</h1>
         <div>
         <img src="Images\fy_chZvG.jpg" max-width:100%; />
         </div>
         <p>We decided to go to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.  It was fun, but I wouldn't recommend it.  It was like a giant Hard Rock Cafe.</p>
         
         <h1>Niagara Falls</h1>
         <div>
            <img src="Images\Family.jpg" max-width:100%; />
            </div>
         <p>Niagara Falls did not disappoint.  It was absolutely beautiful there.  There is no humidity up there so the weather was just perfect!</p>

         <h1>Toronto</h1>
         <div>
            <img src ="Images\Toronto.jpg"  />
            </div>
         <p>After we left Niagara Falls, we headed up to Toronto. We rented an Airbnb in the city on the 35th floor.  The view was amazing! We also went up to the top of the CN Tower</p>
         <div>

         <p>Great view from the CN Tower.</p>
