			<h1>Our Trip to Canada</h1>
     </header>
         <p>Last year we decided to take a big trip after our son Nicholas graduated from Kirkwoood High School. </p>

         <h1>First Stop: Lake Erie<h1/>
         <p>We rented a small air bnb on Lake Erie.  It was so beautiful, but the weather didn't cooperate! It rained the whole time we were there!<p/>

         <h1>Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</h1>
         <p>We decided to go to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, OH.  It was fun, but I wouldn't recommend it.  There were many artists that should have been there, but were not.</p>

         <h1>Niagara Falls<h1>
         <p>Niagara Falls did not disappoint.  It was absolutely beautiful there.  There is not humidity up there so the weather was just perfect!</p>

         <h1>Toronto</h1>
         <p>After we left Niagara Falls, we headed up to Toronto.  We rented an Airbnb in the city on the 35th floor.  The view was amazing! We also went up to the top of the CN Tower</p>
